I recently had the opportunity to participate in the Datathon hosted by Anadolu Hayat Emeklilik, a leading insurance company. During this event, I crafted a predictive model aimed at
identifying the various insurance types that potential clients might choose. Despite the challenge of juggling this project with my midterm exams, I managed to contribute meaningfully
to the Datathon. This experience not only honed my data science skills but also deepened my understanding of the insurance sector's analytical needs.
